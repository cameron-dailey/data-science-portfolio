# Python Portfolio

This folder contains Python projects demonstrating EDA, supervised ML (polynomial regression and decision trees),
unsupervised learning, and a simple web scraper. All scripts save plots to a `plots/` folder and read data from `data/`.

Projects:
- **eda-analysis/**: Data cleaning and visualization on a synthetic ecommerce dataset.
- **ml-polynomial-regression/**: Nonlinear regression using polynomial features with scikit-learn.
- **ml-decision-tree/**: Churn classification via DecisionTree and RandomForest with evaluation metrics.
- **ml-unsupervised/**: K-means with PCA visualization and cluster profiling.
- **web-scraper/**: BeautifulSoup-based scraper that reads a local mock HTML and exports a CSV.
- **feature-scaling-demo/**: Demonstrates the effect of `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` on numeric data.  
  Includes visual comparisons of scaled distributions and saves plots to `/plots/`.
