# Banking Queries

Goal: Demonstrate SQL joins, aggregation, subqueries, and filters using a retail banking schema.

Includes:
- Customer and account linking
- Monthly deposit/withdraw trends
- Top customers by volume
- Active and negative-balance detection

Tested with PostgreSQL 15 syntax (works in MySQL with small modifications).

**Also includes advanced topics:** window functions (running balance), customer ranking by partition, and a recursive CTE interest simulation.
