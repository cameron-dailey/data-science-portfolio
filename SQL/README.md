# SQL Portfolio

This folder demonstrates core SQL techniques across three domains:

- **banking-queries/**: Transaction and customer analytics for a sample retail bank.
- **university-database/**: Academic database queries with JOINs, aggregations, and subqueries.
- **ecommerce-analytics/**: Business metrics, cohorts, and retention analysis for an online retailer.

Each project folder includes:
- A `schema.sql` file describing the database tables
- A `queries.sql` file with advanced examples and comments
- A `README.md` explaining the purpose and highlights
