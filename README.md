## R Projects

| Folder | Focus | Key Skills |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `regression-analysis/` | Linear & polynomial regression with CV and RMSE evaluation | `tidyverse`, `broom`, `modelr`, `rsample` |
| `clustering-analysis/` | Customer segmentation via K-means and PCA visualization | `factoextra`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr` |
| `shiny-dashboard/` | Interactive visualization app built with Shiny | `shiny`, `ggplot2` |

**Highlights**
- End-to-end data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
- Cross-validation and model comparison using RMSE and R².
- Interactive dashboards for exploring key business metrics.

## Python Projects

| Folder | Focus | Key Skills |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `eda-analysis/` | Exploratory data analysis and visualization | `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| `ml-polynomial-regression/` | Regression modeling using polynomial features | `scikit-learn`, `numpy` |
| `ml-decision-tree/` | Classification with Decision Trees & Random Forest | `sklearn.tree`, `RandomForestClassifier` |
| `ml-unsupervised/` | Clustering and dimensionality reduction | `KMeans`, `PCA`, `matplotlib` |
| `web-scraper/` | Product data extraction from a mock website | `BeautifulSoup`, `requests` |

**Highlights**
- Clean, reproducible machine learning pipelines.
- Feature engineering, scaling, and performance evaluation (RMSE, ROC-AUC).
- Realistic EDA and automation scripts for data gathering.

## SQL Projects

| Folder | Focus | Key Skills |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `banking-queries/` | Retail banking transactions and customer analytics | `JOIN`, `CTE`, `Window Functions`, `Recursive Queries` |
| `university-database/` | Academic performance and institutional metrics | `Aggregate`, `Subquery`, `Rank`, `Cross Join` |
| `ecommerce-analytics/` | Revenue, retention, and customer segmentation | `RFM`, `Rolling Averages`, `Window Functions` |

**Highlights**
- Advanced analytical queries with `RANK`, `NTILE`, and recursive `CTEs`.
- Real business logic: lifetime value, active users, and monthly retention.
- Optimized for PostgreSQL but portable across most SQL dialects.
